Cotaught the How People Learn: Theoretical Foundations course. This doctoral course explores theoretical and empirical perspectives on the questions: What is knowledge and knowing? What is learning? What is teaching? How do contexts influence teaching, knowing, and learning? A central goal of the course is to encourage students to consider these questions and their interconnections for themselves, to examine ways scholars and practitioners have answered them, and to develop an analytical framework to use in examining contemporary practices in settings that include formal and informal, urban and international.
