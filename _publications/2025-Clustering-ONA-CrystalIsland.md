This study investigates student learning and interest within the context of a single-player, open-world game designed for microbiology inquiry. The game immerses players in the role of investigative scientists tasked with diagnosing a mysterious illness on a remote island. Ordered Network Analysis (ONA) was combined with clustering techniques to analyze in-game actions (i.e., interactions with non-playable characters, exploration, and utilization of in-game educational tools) allowing us to construct student archetypes based on the behavioral patterns of 122 middle schoolers. The analysis identified four distinct clusters of students with varying engagement patterns—two showing apparent patterns of engagement and two showing apparent patterns of disengagement. The study contributes insights into tailoring educational game designs to address disengaged or ineffective behaviors, enhancing the efficacy of game-based learning experiences.
