Classroom observation has been used to obtain training labels for affect detection, but it is expensive for large representative samples. Active Learning (AL) methods have been proposed to address this challenge by identifying the specific samples that should be labeled to improve detector performance, based on a metric of informativeness. While previous work has investigated the potential benefits of AL methods in affect detection, they have considered scenarios that may not completely reflect reality, where an observer can code any student and time window within the entire data set. Unfortunately, actual use of such a method can only take place in the current time window – classroom observers cannot time-travel. This paper explores the potential benefit of AL methods in a scenario that more closely mimics the human coder’s observation process in a real classroom, where the coder can only observe behavior occurring at the current moment. Our experimental results show that AL methods slightly improve the performance indicators of binary detectors for concentration, confusion, and frustration compared to control sampling methods. However, there is no benefit for boredom detection. These findings have implications for the use of active learning-based data collection protocols for developing affect detectors.
