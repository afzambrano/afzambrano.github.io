excerpt: 'We compare four approaches to codebook development–a fully manual approach, a fully automated approach, and two approaches that leverage ChatGPT within specific steps of the codebook development process. The results show that approaches that automate early stages of codebook development take less time to complete overall. Hybrid approaches (whether GPT participates early or late in the process) produce codebooks that can be applied more reliably and were rated as better quality by humans.'

In qualitative data analysis, codebooks offer a systematic framework for establishing shared interpretations of themes and patterns. While the utility of codebooks is well-established in educational research, the manual process of developing and refining codes that emerge bottom-up from data presents a challenge in terms of time, effort, and potential for human error. This paper explores the potentially transformative role that could be played by Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT (GPT-4), in addressing these challenges by automating aspects of the codebook development process. We compare four approaches to codebook development – a fully manual approach, a fully automated approach, and two approaches that leverage ChatGPT within specific steps of the codebook development process. We do so in the context of studying transcripts from math tutoring lessons. The resultant four codebooks were evaluated in terms of whether the codes could reliably be applied to data by human coders, in terms of the human-rated quality of codes and codebooks, and whether different approaches yielded similar or overlapping codes. The results show that approaches that automate early stages of codebook development take less time to complete overall. Hybrid approaches (whether GPT participates early or late in the process) produce codebooks that can be applied more reliably and were rated as better quality by humans. Hybrid approaches and a fully human approach produce similar codebooks; the fully automated approach was an outlier. Findings indicate that ChatGPT can be valuable for improving qualitative codebooks for use in AIED research, but human participation is still essential.
