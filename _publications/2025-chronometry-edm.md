excerpt: 'This study builds on two prior investigations into the exponential decay of epistemic emotions, expanding the analysis of affective chronometry by incorporating two detection methods based on student self-reports and trained observer labels in a game-based learning environment. Our findings indicate that boredom exhibits the slowest decay across both detection methods, while confusion is the least persistent. Furthermore, we found that higher situational interest and self-efficacy are associated with greater persistence in engaged concentration, as identified by both detection methods.'

Research on epistemic emotions has often focused on how students transition between affective states (e.g., affect dynamics). More recently, studies have examined the properties of cases where a student remains in the same affective state over time, finding that the duration of a student’s affective state is important for multiple learning outcomes. However, the likelihood of remaining in a given affective state has not been widely studied across different methods or systems. Additionally, the role of motivational factors in the persistence or decay of affective states remains underexplored. This study builds on two prior investigations into the exponential decay of epistemic emotions, expanding the analysis of affective chronometry by incorporating two detection methods based on student self-reports and trained observer labels in a game-based learning environment. We also examine the relationship between motivational measures and affective decay. Our findings indicate that boredom exhibits the slowest decay across both detection methods, while confusion is the least persistent. Furthermore, we found that higher situational interest and self-efficacy are associated with greater persistence in engaged concentration, as identified by both detection methods. This work provides novel insights into how motivational factors shape affective chronometry, contributing to a deeper understanding of the temporal dynamics of epistemic emotions.
