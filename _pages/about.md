I am a doctoral candidate in the Learning Sciences and Technologies Program at the University of Pennsylvania’s Graduate School of Education, a senior researcher at the Penn Center for Learning Analytics, and a Colombian Fulbright Scholar. Under the supervision of Professors Ryan Baker and Jaclyn Ocumpaugh, my work at PCLA explores how artificial intelligence and machine learning can transform learning experiences in digital environments. In particular, we develop and apply learning analytics and data mining methods to analyze how students interact with educational software, aiming to better understand how these interactions influence learning processes and outcomes.

Affect and Emotions
---
I investigate how students’ emotions emerge while they interact with various digital learning environments. To do this, I develop sensor-free machine learning affect detectors trained on students’ self-reports and classroom observations, following the [BROMP](https://learninganalytics.upenn.edu/ryanbaker/bromp.html) monitoring protocol. Using these detectors, I examine how affective states relate to motivational and cognitive factors, the behaviors students adopt while engaging with learning tools, and their overall learning outcomes.

- **October 2025 --** I recently attended the International Conference on Quantitative Ethnography, where our team published multiple articles investigating the use of large language models to code interviews and movement, and analyze how motivational features impact how students feel and interact with educational games.
